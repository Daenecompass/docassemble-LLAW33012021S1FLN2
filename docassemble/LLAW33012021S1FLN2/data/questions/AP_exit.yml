question: Report complete
subquestion: |
  A report you can send to DPTI (the Department for Planning, Transport and Infrastructure) has been generated. We
  %if report_email_sent_ok:
    have emailed it to your address (${ user_email }), however if you don't receive it within a few minutes
  %else:
    attempted to email it to your address (${ user_email }), however an error occurred, so instead
  %endif
  you can download it here: ${ action_button_html(FLNreport_file.url_for(), label="<span>download</span>", color="secondary", size="sm", icon="file-download", classname="download-button") }
  
  Unfortunately, DPTI doesn't provide an email address to send these to, so we ask that you print the report and send it by mail to:
  
  <p class="dpti-address">
  Department for Infrastructure and Transport<br>
  GPO BOX 1533<br>
  Adelaide SA 5001
  </p>

  Thankyou for using the Paws Rights app, we hope that with your help in sending these reports (and gathering statistics) we can push for change!
