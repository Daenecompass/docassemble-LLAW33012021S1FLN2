question: Report complete
subquestion: |
  A report you can send to DPTI (the Department for Planning,
  Transport and Infrastructure) has been generated. You can download
  it here: ${ action_button_html(FLNreport_file.url_for(), label="<span>download</span>", color="secondary", size="sm", icon="file-download", classname="download-button") }
  
  We
  % if FLNself_reporting:
  %   if report_email_sent_ok:
  have also emailed it to your address (${ sanitise(user_email) }).
  %   else:
  also attempted to email it to your address (${ sanitise(user_email) }),
  however an error occurred.
  %   endif
  % else:
  %   if report_email_sent_ok:
  have also emailed it to the provided address (${ sanitise(user_email) }).
  %   else:
  also attempted to email it to the provided address (${ sanitise(user_email) }),
  however an error occurred.
  %   endif
  % endif
  
  Unfortunately, DPTI doesn't provide an email address to send these reports to, so we ask that you print the report and send it by mail to:
  
  <p class="dpti-address">
  Department for Infrastructure and Transport<br>
  GPO BOX 1533<br>
  Adelaide SA 5001
  </p>
 
  You can also complain to the Human Rights Commission at:    
  <a target="_self" href="https://humanrights.gov.au/complaints/make-complaint">Human Rights Commission Complaints</a>
 
  Thank you for using the Paws Rights app. We hope that sending these reports will help towards a push for change!
