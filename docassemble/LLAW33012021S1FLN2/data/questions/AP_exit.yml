question: Report complete
subquestion: |
  A report you can send to DPTI (the Department for Planning, Transport and Infrastructure) has been emailed to your address. Unfortunately, DPTI doesn't provide an email address to send these to, so we ask that you print the report and send it by mail to:
  
  <p class="dpti-address">
  Department for Infrastructure and Transport<br>
  77 Grenfell Street<br>
  Adelaide SA 5000
  </p>
  
  Thankyou for using the Paws Rights app, we hope that with your help in sending these reports, and providing statistics, we can push for change!
