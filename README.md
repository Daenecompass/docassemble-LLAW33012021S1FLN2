# Paws Rights Web-App

This is an app designed for people in SA with assistance animals, who can often be refused access to Ubers, taxis, public transport, and so on. It helps build a report of each transport refusal, ready to be sent to DPTI. It can also be used to gather anonymous statistics of how many refusals are occuring, what areas these occur in, which transport services are involved, and so on.
